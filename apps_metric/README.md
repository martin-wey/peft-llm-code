# Metric Card for apps_metric 

## Metric Description
This metric is used to evaluate code generation on the [APPS benchmark](https://huggingface.co/datasets/codeparrot/apps).

## How to Use
You can load the metric and use it with the following commands:

```python
from evaluate import load
apps_metric = load('codeparrot/apps_metric')
# to evaluate generations made for all levels for example
results = apps_metric.compute(predictions=generations, level="all")
```

### Inputs
**generations** list(list(str)): List of code generations, each sub-list corresponds to the generations for a problem in APPS dataset, **the order of the samples in the dataset must be kept (with respect to the difficulty level)**.

### Output Values

**average accuracy**: when a single solution is generated, average accuracy computes the average of test cases that are passed.

**strict accuracy**: when a single solution is generated, strict accuracy computes the average number of problems that pass all their test cases.

**pass@k**: when multiple solutions are generated per problem, pass@k is the metric originally used for the [HumanEval](https://huggingface.co/datasets/openai_humaneval) benchmark. For more details please refer to the [metric space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/evaluate-metric/code_eval) and [Codex paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.03374v2.pdf).
